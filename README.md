Purpose: This project was created to detect pitch from musical instruments. The operating range is from about 60Hz to 1500hz.

How it works: The app receives input from a microphone and applies an autocorrelation function to detect the input sound's harmonic period. Using this period, we are able to find frequency knowing that Frequency = 1/Period . 

Summary: A pitch detection app running on the web that is capable of tuning musical instruments!
